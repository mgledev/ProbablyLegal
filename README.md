# 🧪 ProbablyLegal – Educational Sandbox of Grey-Zone Ideas

**ProbablyLegal** is a personal lab of experimental, slightly questionable (but still legal) projects that explore the grey area between creativity, hardware control, and AI.  
Here you'll find tools that mix fun, curiosity, and machine intelligence — all designed for **research, prototyping, and educational use only**.

## 🎯 Currently Included

### ▸ `VisualTriggerAI/`

A real-time computer vision system that analyzes a streamed gameplay window using YOLOv9c and triggers an external device (e.g., Teensy via UART) when specific visual conditions are met.

> 🧠 Combines AI, object detection, serial communication, and human-like behavior simulation (e.g., random delay and probabilistic triggers).
